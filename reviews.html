                    Norwegian prog-rockers Leprous recently concluded the North American leg of their Aphelion Tour with a show at the Opera House in Toronto. Supported by German progressive metal band The Ocean, the Aphelion tour consisted of 33 shows across the United
                    States and Canada, beginning on March 1st. The Toronto show, along with a handful of other Canadian dates, was initially scheduled for the first week of the tour but had to be pushed to the end due to uncertainty surrounding COVID-related
                    restrictions. It’s fortunate for Canadian fans that Leprous was able to quickly reschedule those dates, as opposed to having to cancel them entirely. This show was well worth having to wait that one extra month.</p>

                <p>On the evening of Wednesday, March 2nd, progressive metal legends Dream Theater graced the stage at Meridian Hall for the Toronto stop of their “Top of the World Tour”. This tour, which had been postponed from the previous fall, comes
                    in support of the band’s fifteenth studio album, “A View From the Top of the World”, released in October of last year. Due to Ontario’s COVID-related restrictions, there was plenty of uncertainty regarding whether or not this show
                    would be able to happen. Fortunately for a few thousand fans and ticket holders, capacity limits for concert venues were lifted on the first of the month, just in time for this show to proceed as planned.</p>

                <p>An image flickers on the screen, the burning insignia of the Order of the Dragon to the backdrop of “At the Gates of Midian”. This could not have been a more enthralling setup for the recent Cradle of Filth Livestream and as a long-time
                    fan, I understood exactly where this presentation was going. This wasn’t just a band playing their songs in an empty hall with some fancy lighting and multimedia, this was a guided tour of Midian itself!</p>
